Final Capstone Project

Introduction / Problem:

An Australian entrepreneur has a pharmacy chain called “Priceline pharmacy”. He would like to expand his business to America. 
He wants to setup his first store in New York due to his love of the TV show friends. 
To ensure he has the highest chance of success, he wants to find which borough has the least amount of pharmacy per capita.

Data:
In order to execute this plan, we need have the number of pharmacy in each borough divided by the borough population. 
The number of pharmacy in each borough can be obtained using FourSquare location. 
The population in each borough can be obtained from the US Census Bureau. The latest data is from 1st July 2019. 
The US Census Bureau is the most ideal source as it is from the government.
